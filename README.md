# Text-to-Speech-MelGAN
Reproduction of [MelGAN](https://github.com/descriptinc/melgan-neurips) vocoder fine-tuned for end-to-end speech synthesis using NVIDIA's [Tacotron2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2). A group project for my MSc course 'Deep learning'. 

We trained MelGAN for 2624 epochs (12 days) on a single NVIDIA K40 GPU at <https://hpc.grnet.gr/en/> using Slurm jobs. In the following notebook, we provide various samples and the ability to test our pre-trained model in text-to-speech:
